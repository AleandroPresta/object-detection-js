# object-detection-js
A project that uses Tensorflow.js to build an object detector inside a Web Page.

To use Tensorflow.js locally is necessary to install webpack (already in the dependencies) and then execute the command
webpack

Then, to load a local image is necessary to install in Visual Studio Code the Live Server extension. Then do:

F1 -> Live Server: Open With Live Server

This way Tensorflow.js can find the image at the path http://127.0.0.1:5500/src/images that could not find locally.
